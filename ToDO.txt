TODO
- implement premium api check if it works

- update main algorithm for detection
- update & improve notification filter logic for real life usage

- update logic to handle real time events instead of minutes for time distances in processing (since real time events aren't in a fixed timeframe)
- build variable frame for test and real life


set frame size to right size - public static int frameSize = 20; // Frame size for analysis
