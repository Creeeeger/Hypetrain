TODO
Version 1.0:
--Dip checker--
- get time state saver and a shift for absolute dips to ensure we enter at the right time -> train DIPPER (GIGIDI) ML model -- sorry that had to be written down


--Rise checker--
- add a rise in percentage to be used in case inference says no (add risk category)

- add downwards & upwards trend-line check for support


DO ENHANCED EFFECTIVITY OF SECOND ANALYSIS
Version 1.5:
- [ ] Update frame sizes for second based processing
- [ ] Update indicators for second data (maybe add time frequency variable)

Version 2.0:
- [ ] Update inference for second data
- [ ] Update linking for second data

In advance already second data won't change the world
