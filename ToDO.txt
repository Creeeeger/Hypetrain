TODO
Version 1.0:
--Dip checker--
- get time state saver and a shift for absolute dips to ensure we enter at the right time
- maybe train DIP ML model
- make a variable movement of the average of the stock to make a proper dip limit to ensure that dips only occur at the right amount

--Rise checker--
- Create fill the gap (local R line indicator)
- add a minimum rise tracker before notification make this stock dependant hence different levels of movement influence things differently
- add a rise in percentage to be used in case inference says no
- add downwards trend-line check
- add upwards trend-line check

Version 1.5:
- [ ] Update frame sizes for second based processing
- [ ] Update indicators for second data (maybe add time frequency variable)

Version 2.0:
- [ ] Update inference for second data
- [ ] Update linking for second data

In advance already second data won't change the world
