## Model knowledge

### Buffer size

- Feed in a time period buffer: get less aggressive values and a more smoothened output
- Feed in temp buffer of repeated values: get aggressive switches for the Time an event occurs
- No matter what size single buffer is more efficient and accurate hence the one event buffer is used.

### Window size for training

- Short windows of 5 Minutes give clustered data without clear separation. This is because the LSTM architecture can't
  detect patterns in that short time.
- 10 Minutes are still to short to separate any events
- 20 Minutes gives good data but yet not good enough to ensure that noise is classified as low outcome
- 30 Minutes do the job well but still many BS events are captured and high ranked so 40 minutes is a better choice
  since filtering works better there
- 35-40 Minutes give a good frame with clear separation
- Due to random IDKKKKK sometimes the range from 25-35 is the best: Maybe I get onto something and I can stabilize it, who knows...

### Weighting of classes

- the weights of classes added loads of noise to the result so it got removed

### Batch size

- 64 has just turned out to be the best with the least noise
