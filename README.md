# üöÇ Hype Train ‚Äî System Ruleset

> ### "Buy Fear ‚Äî Sell Euphoria."
> Stay mentally stable. Not every hype is a win. Most hype is bait.

---

## üß† Core Principles

- Only triggers when **others are panicking** ‚Äî look for *high volume flushes* and forced liquidations.
- FOMO is auto-filtered ‚Äî **no entry** without a confirmed **retracement** signal.
- This system survives because it *waits*.

---

## üíÄ If You Miss an Entry

### DO NOT CHASE.

Patience is survival.

> *Wait for tomorrow's setup.*

#### Penalty:

Watch *The Big Short* on loop until market close.

---

## ‚ò†Ô∏è After 2 Consecutive Losses

> Trading is a performance sport. Mindset > Setup.

Mandatory:

- 48 hour *no-trading* break.
- Backtest 50 historical setups from your strategy library.
- Rebuild confidence through data ‚Äî not hope.

---

## üß® Kill FOMO Forever

### Entry Paradox:

> *The harder it feels to buy, the better the trade.*

---

### Visualize Sellers:

That volume spike?  
Someone's *life savings* just got liquidated.

---

### Institutional Mirror:

Ask yourself:
> *"What would Citadel do?"*  
> Then do the opposite.

---

## Final Reminder:

> FOMO & Confirmation Bias = Account Killers.

They lead to:

- Impulsive entries
- Chasing garbage setups
- Ignoring risk
- Breaking rules

Discipline is alpha.  
Obey the system ‚Äî or be the exit liquidity.

## Model knowledge & research

### Buffer size

- Feed in a time period buffer: get less aggressive values and a more smoothened output
- Feed in temp buffer of repeated values: get aggressive switches for the Time an event occurs
- No matter what size single buffer is more efficient and accurate hence the one event buffer is used.

### Window size for training

- Short windows of 5 Minutes give clustered data without clear separation. This is because the LSTM architecture can't
  detect patterns in that short time.
- 10 Minutes are still to short to separate any events
- 20 Minutes gives good data but yet not good enough to ensure that noise is classified as low outcome
- 30 Minutes do the job well but still many BS events are captured and high ranked so 40 minutes is a better choice
  since filtering works better there
- 35-40 Minutes give a good frame with clear separation
- Due to random IDKKKKK sometimes the range from 25-35 is the best: Maybe I get onto something and I can stabilize it,
  who knows...

### Weighting of classes

- the weights of classes added loads of noise to the result so it got removed

### Batch size

- 64 has just turned out to be the best with the least noise

### Bollinger Bands

- Synthetic value for higher stability as it turned out

### üìà Different Times Require Different Measures

To let **HypeTrain** operate effectively under varying market conditions, I've implemented a preset weighting table.  
These weightings adapt HypeTrain's behavior to match different environments like Bull/Bear Markets or during high
volatility phases.

| **Category** | **Bull Market** | **Bear Market** | **High Volatility** | **Scraper Mode** |
|--------------|:---------------:|:---------------:|:-------------------:|:----------------:|
| **TREND**    |      0.30       |      0.15       |        0.20         |       0.10       |
| **MOMENTUM** |      0.40       |      0.25       |        0.35         |       0.10       |
| **STATS**    |      0.15       |      0.30       |        0.25         |       0.45       |
| **ADVANCED** |      0.15       |      0.30       |        0.20         |       0.35       |

> üõ†Ô∏è *These dynamic weight adjustments allow HypeTrain to stay sharp across all market terrains.*
